# Actin_Length_Simulations
Here we provide the main codes used in the work **Emergence and maintenance of variable-length actin filaments in a limiting pool of building blocks**. These codes are written in FORTRAN90 language and tested in Linux. Commands to generate the ensembles using the codes were passed using shell scripting. Two MATLAB codes are provided for basic analysis and visuliation. Commands for running the codes related to each figures in the work are named likewise, e.g. commands for running the codes to generate Figure 2 of the manuscript is named as "Fig_2.sh". *Please note that we do not provide a full automated way to generate the figures of the work but provide the respective main codes with some examples*.
## growthcode_1.f90
This code was used to simulate the effective actin growth descriptions where explicit profilin and formin mediated nucleation was ignored. This code was used for Figures 2, 3, 4 and 6 in the manuscript.

## growthcode_2.f90
This code was used to simulate the actin growth descriptions with explicit profilin and formin mediated nucleation. This code was used in Figure 5 and many SI figures where the full model was explored.

## Figure 2: Spontaneous nucleation promotes F-actin length heterogeneity
- Data for Figure.2 can be generated by running Fig_2.sh which calls growthcode_1.f90 to simulate pure actin growth without any other actin binding proteins.
- The MATLAB codes Average_timeseries.m and Length_distribution.m can be run to generate the time evolution of average quantities and length distribution.

## Figure 3: F-actin capping increases filament length heterogeneity
- Data for Figure.3 can be generated by running Fig_3.sh which calls growthcode_1.f90 to simulate pure actin growth with capping proteins.
- The MATLAB codes Average_timeseries.m and Length_distribution.m can be run to generate the time evolution of average quantities and length distribution.
